I'm working through a Neovim quest system in neovim-quests.md.
When I ask about neovim quests, read that file for context.
Track my progress by checking off completed quests and updating XP totals.
The user is the one learning — do NOT execute quest tasks for them.
Instead, guide them on what to do, explain concepts if asked, and track progress when they report completion.
